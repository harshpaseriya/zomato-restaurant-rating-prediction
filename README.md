# Zomato_Restaurant_Rating_Prediction



Bengaluru being an IT capital of India. Most of the people here are dependent mainly on the restaurant food as they donâ€™t have time to cook for themselves. With such an overwhelming demand of restaurants it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location. In the world of rising new technology and innovation, healthcare industry is advancing with the role of Artificial Intelligence. Machine learning algorithms can help to early detection of the disease and to improve the quality of the life. This study demonstrates the how different classification algorithms can forecasts the presence of the disease. Different classification algorithms such as Logistic regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree have been tested and compared to predict the better outcome of the model.

## Technical aspect:
- Python 3.7
- Front-end: HTML
- Back-end: Flask
- IDE: Jupyter Notebook, Vscode
- Deployment: Heroku

## Workflow
## Data Collection:
Zomato Restaurant Dataset from Kaggle.

## Data Pre-processing:
- Missing values handling by Simple imputation (median strategy)
- Outliers detection and removal by boxplot and percentile methods
- Categorical features handling by ordinal encoding and label encoding
- Feature scaling done by Standard Scalar method

## Model Creation and Evaluation:
Various classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree were tested.
Random Forest was chosen for the final model training and testing.

Model performance evaluated based on accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report.


## Model Deployment
The final model is deployed on Heroku using Flask framework
